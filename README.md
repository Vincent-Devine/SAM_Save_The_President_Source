**Project description :**<br />
We made a third-person infiltration game called SAM (Security Assistance Machine). It was developped on Unreal and is playable on PS4 as well as PC. <br />
You play as SAM, a robot tasked of saving the president from his kidnappers. <br />
To do so, you have to infiltrate a secret laboratory, you may kill as many enemies as you want but if the alarm is activated the mission will fail.

**Features:**

Detection system : 
- We used Unreal Pawn system to implement the detection system (vision and hearing) which is given to the enemies raising or lowering their awareness.
- We coupled it with a personalized stealth system linked to the lights. <br />The closer the player is to the lights the quicker enemies will spot him. <br />The player can see his visibililty status on screen with a bar next to the crosshair.

Player :
- Has basic movements
- Can crouch to be more discrete and go into smaller spaces
- Can aim (when an enemy is in range a red dot will appear)
- Can shoot (only if he is aiming before)
- Can move corpses to hide them or put them into bins

Enemy:
- Enemies possess 4 behaviors :
<br />Patrol (between pre-defined points), 
<br />Suspicious (will go to last position where the player was seen),
<br />Alert (will follow and shoot the player),
<br />GoingToTheAlarm (after using all their amunitions they will go to activate the alarm)

- Enemies can communicate (share alerts and level of awareness) if they are in range of each other
- Enemies will detect corpses
